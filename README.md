# CodeAssignmentJavaDeveloper

This is a readme file on how I code the Java assignment

A)
1a) I created a junit file with test cases each with the purpose of testing the Bird class methods
1b) I created a new class and transfer the Animal class over to it and different methods each calling a different subclass and its methods from the Animals class so that the main method looks more organized and readable

2) I created a 2 new classes duck and chicken each with their own personal sound and action

3)I created a Rosster class with its own personal sound and action without extending to another class to showcase how to model a rooster class without inheritance

4) For this I created a dog and cat class. Both extends to the Animal class.
  Then I create 3 parrot classes with each of them extending to its respective animals such as Dog, Cat, Rooster
  
B)
1) I created a fish class the same way as I create the Bird class
2) I created 2 classes Shark and Clownfish. The Shark and Clownfish classes each have their own personal methods, 2 instance variables colour and size and a set of get methods.
3) I created a dolphin class that extends to the Animal class instead of the fish class

D)
1) I created a Caterpillar class that extends to Animal class and a butterfly that extends to Caterpillat class
2)In the main method I created a try catch finally statement. In the try statement, I called the method with the caterpillar object and set a delay of 5 sec. After the 5 sec, it will call the method with the butterfly object. This is to metamorphosis from caterpillar to
butterfly

Extra)
I have created a switch statement that will allow others to view the animal actions easier
